# synthetic-biology
## lecture 1, Notes:
  Molecular biology of all eukaryotes are almost the same.<br />
  Everyday in your body there are roughly 10<sup>11 </sup> cells that grow and divide<br />
  protozoa and metazoa, the suffix zoa prefer to animal as in zoo, protozoa represent single cell organism <br />
  and metazoa represents multicellulat organisms <br />
  cyto prefers to cell <br />
  cells like ours have 5-10 million ribosomes in cytoplasm <br />

### keywords: 
  mitochondria, golgi apparatus, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum

## lecture 2, Notes:
  hydrogen bond is of 5kcal/mol roughly while covanlent bond has 80kcal/mol energy.<br/>
  glucose can be called as hexose.<br/>
  lactase is the enzyme to breakdown lactose (milk sugar), some people later in their life become<br/>
  lactose intolerant as their body shut down the production of lactase. 

### keywords: 
vesicle, micelle

## lecture 4, Notes:
  A,C,T,G,U = adenine, cytosine, thymine, guanine, uracil --
  T vs U, uracil is found in RNA and thymine is found in DNA--
  base + sugar = nucleoside + phosphate = nucleotide
