# synthetic-biology
## lecture 1, Notes:
Molecular biology of all eukaryotes are almost the same.  
Everyday in your body there are roughly 10<sup>11 </sup> cells that grow and divide. 
protozoa and metazoa, the suffix zoa prefer to animal as in zoo, protozoa represent single cell organism  
and metazoa represents multicellulat organisms  
cyto prefers to cell. 
cells like ours have 5-10 million ribosomes in cytoplasm  
10<sup>16</sup> cell division in human lifetime.   

### keywords: 
mitochondria, golgi apparatus, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum

## lecture 2, Notes:
hydrogen bond is of 5kcal/mol roughly while covanlent bond has 80kcal/mol energy.  
glucose can be called as hexose.<br/>
lactase is the enzyme to breakdown lactose (milk sugar).  
some people later in their life become lactose intolerant as their body shut down the production of lactase.   

### keywords: 
vesicle, micelle

## lecture 4, Notes:
A,C,T,G,U = adenine, cytosine, thymine, guanine, uracil   
T vs U, uracil is found in RNA and thymine is found in DNA  
A and T are opposite to one another and G and C are opposite to one another. 
base + sugar = nucleoside + phosphate = nucleotide <br/>
if double helix has more G and C then it is going to have more hydrogen bond then with less G and C. 
and so it require more energy to pull apart the two strand of double helix by breaking down the hydrogen bond. 


### keywords:
  replication , transcription and translation
  
## lecture 5, Notes:
RNA may have been doing the job of storing information in starting of life and gradually DNA took over the job.  
glycolysis, glyco prefers to sugar, lysis is breaking down of certain compunds.  


### keywords: 
  lipids
  
## lecture 6, Notes: (prof eric lander)
  genetics : study of organism - one component (mutant)   
  molecular biology realised the study of genes and proteins are two different side of the same coins.   
  Gene: factor of inheritance controlling a trait. 
  Alleles: alternative forms of gene. 
  Phenotype : appearance   
  Genotype: pair of alleles carried by the individuals like RR, Rr, rr,  
  homozygotes: Genotype that has two alleles of same type like RR, rr. 
  heterozyotes: individual having genotype of alternative type. 
  word dominant and recessive prefers to phenotype not to alleles. 
  Meiosis is the type of cell division that creates egg and sperm cells.  
  mitosis, the process of making new body cells. 
  
## lecture 7:
when recombination rate is 0 then it means that genes are very close to each other.  
when recombination rate is 50% then the genes are on different chromosome or very far from each other.  
### keywords: 
genetic map, recombination rate. 
  
## lecture 8: 
yeast the proper eukaryote has 16 pair of chromosomes.  
yeast that are able to grow on minimal media that are known as prototrophs, Auxotrophs are the yeast. 
that lost the ability to grow on minimal media.  
arginine auxotrophs: organism that are unable to grow and make their own organism and hence needs the supply of arginine to grow   
characterising mutant by the test of recessivity. 

### kewywords: 
haploid and daploid. 
complementatation group in genes ?  

## lecture 9:
brca-1 mutation, high risk of breast cancer. 
chromosome 17 bonafide autosome (what does it means). 
brca-1 mutation, high risk of breast cancer. 
autosomal chromosome:chromosome that are not sex chromosomes means they do not define the sex of the offsprings. 

### keywords:
epistasis. 
sex-linked trait,  
sex limited trait. 
autosomal ?  
cystic fibrosis. 

## lecture 10:
  bacteriophage, phage means eaters. 
  semi conservative replication:one strand is used as template to replicate another. 
  
### keywords: 
  s-strain bacteria and R-strain bacteria. 
  radioactive labelling. 
  
## lecture 11:
  

## she has her mother laugh 
each mitochondria carries 37 genes of its own which encodes protein essential for its task   
mitochondria divides on their own making a copy of their own DNA without meiosis  
only mothers mitochondria becomes the mitochondria of their child  
what is nucleotide polymorphism ?  
Rh factor should be same between blood donor and receiver  
how does the new mutation arise in human DNA. 
what is heretability in a trait ?  
Heritability does not indicate what proportion of a trait is determined by genes and what proportion is determined by environment.  
So, a heritability of 0.7 does not mean that a trait is 70% caused by genetic factors; it means than 70% of the variability in. 
the trait in a population is due to genetic differences among people.  

### (key words):
gene drive ?   
transoceanic amnesia   
pedigree   
ectoderm mesoderm  
heretibality
