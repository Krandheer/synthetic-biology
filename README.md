# synthetic-biology
## lecture 1, Notes:
  Molecular biology of all eukaryotes are almost the same.<br />
  Everyday in your body there are roughly 10<sup>11 </sup> cells that grow and divide<br />
  protozoa and metazoa, the suffix zoa prefer to animal as in zoo, protozoa represent single cell organism <br />
  and metazoa represents multicellulat organisms <br />
  cyto prefers to cell <br />
  cells like ours have 5-10 million ribosomes in cytoplasm <br />
  10<sup>16</sup> cell division in human lifetime. <br/>

### keywords: 
  mitochondria, golgi apparatus, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum

## lecture 2, Notes:
  hydrogen bond is of 5kcal/mol roughly while covanlent bond has 80kcal/mol energy.<br/>
  glucose can be called as hexose.<br/>
  lactase is the enzyme to breakdown lactose (milk sugar), some people later in their life become<br/>
  lactose intolerant as their body shut down the production of lactase. 

### keywords: 
vesicle, micelle

## lecture 4, Notes:
  A,C,T,G,U = adenine, cytosine, thymine, guanine, uracil <br/>
  T vs U, uracil is found in RNA and thymine is found in DNA <br/>
  A and T are opposite to one another and G and C are opposite to one another <br />
  base + sugar = nucleoside + phosphate = nucleotide <br/>
  if double helix has more G and C then it is going to have more hydrogen bond then with less G and C <br/>
  and so it require more energy to pull apart the two strand of double helix by breaking down the hydrogen bond <br/>
  
  
### keywords:
  replication , transcription and translation
  
## lecture 5, Notes:
  RNA may have been doing the job of storing information in starting of life and gradually DNA took over the job <br/>
  glycolysis, glyco prefers to sugar, lysis is breaking down of certain compunds. <br/>
  

### keywords: 
  lipids
