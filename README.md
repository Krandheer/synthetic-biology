# synthetic-biology
## lecture 1, Notes:
    Molecular biology of all eukaryotes are almost the same.
    Everyday in your body there are roughly 10<sup>11 </sup> cells that grow and divide
    protozoa and metazoa, the suffix zoa prefer to animal as in zoo, protozoa represent single cell organism 
    and metazoa represents multicellulat organisms 
    cyto prefers to cell 
    cells like ours have 5-10 million ribosomes in cytoplasm 
    10<sup>16</sup> cell division in human lifetime. 

### keywords: 
mitochondria, golgi apparatus, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum

## lecture 2, Notes:
    hydrogen bond is of 5kcal/mol roughly while covanlent bond has 80kcal/mol energy.<br/>
    glucose can be called as hexose.<br/>
    lactase is the enzyme to breakdown lactose (milk sugar), some people later in their life become<br/>
    lactose intolerant as their body shut down the production of lactase. 

### keywords: 
vesicle, micelle

## lecture 4, Notes:
    A,C,T,G,U = adenine, cytosine, thymine, guanine, uracil <br/>
    T vs U, uracil is found in RNA and thymine is found in DNA <br/>
    A and T are opposite to one another and G and C are opposite to one another <br />
    base + sugar = nucleoside + phosphate = nucleotide <br/>
    if double helix has more G and C then it is going to have more hydrogen bond then with less G and C <br/>
    and so it require more energy to pull apart the two strand of double helix by breaking down the hydrogen bond <br/>


### keywords:
  replication , transcription and translation
  
## lecture 5, Notes:
    RNA may have been doing the job of storing information in starting of life and gradually DNA took over the job <br/>
    glycolysis, glyco prefers to sugar, lysis is breaking down of certain compunds. <br/>
  

### keywords: 
     lipids
  
## lecture 6, Notes: (prof eric lander)
      genetics : study of organism - one component (mutant) <br/>
      molecular biology realised the study of genes and proteins are two different side of the same coins <br/>
      Gene: factor of inheritance controlling a trait <br/>
      Alleles: alternative forms of gene <br/>
      Phenotype : appearance <br/>
      Genotype: pair of alleles carried by the individuals like RR, Rr, rr, <br/>
      homozygotes: Genotype that has two alleles of same type like RR, rr <br/>
      heterozyotes: individual having genotype of alternative type <br/>
      word dominant and recessive prefers to phenotype not to alleles <br/>
      Meiosis is the type of cell division that creates egg and sperm cells. <br/>
      mitosis, the process of making new body cells
  
## lecture 7:
    when recombination rate is 0 then it means that genes are very close to each other. <br/>
    when recombination rate is 50% then the genes are on different chromosome or very far from each other 
### keywords: 
    genetic map, recombination rate <br/>
  
## lecture 8: 
    yeast the proper eukaryote has 16 pair of chromosomes. <br/>
    yeast that are able to grow on minimal media that are known as prototrophs, Auxotrophs are the yeast <br/>
    that lost the ability to grow on minimal media. <br/>
    arginine auxotrophs: organism that are unable to grow and make their own organism and hence needs the supply of arginine to grow <br/>
    characterising mutant by the test of recessivity
### kewywords: 
    haploid and daploid <br/>
    complementatation group in genes ? 
  
## lecture 9:
    brca-1 mutation, high risk of breast cancer <br/>
    chromosome 17 bonafide autosome (what does it means)

### keywords:
    epistasis <br/>
    sex-linked trait, <br/>
    sex limited trait <br>
    autosomal ?<br/>
