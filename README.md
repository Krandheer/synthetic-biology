# synthetic-biology
## lecture 1, Notes:
Molecular biology of all eukaryotes are almost the same. <br />
Everyday in your body there are roughly 10<sup>11 </sup> cells that grow and divide<br />
protozoa and metazoa, the suffix zoa prefer to animal as in zoo, protozoa represent single cell organism <br />
and metazoa represents multicellulat organisms<br /><br />
cyto prefers to cell <br />
cells like ours have 5-10 million ribosomes in cytoplasm <br />
10<sup>16</sup> cell division in human lifetime. <br />

### keywords: 
mitochondria, golgi apparatus, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum

## lecture 2, Notes:
hydrogen bond is of 5kcal/mol roughly while covanlent bond has 80kcal/mol energy.<br/>
glucose can be called as hexose.<br/>
lactase is the enzyme to breakdown lactose (milk sugar), some people later in their life become<br/>
lactose intolerant as their body shut down the production of lactase. 

### keywords: 
vesicle, micelle

## lecture 4, Notes:
A,C,T,G,U = adenine, cytosine, thymine, guanine, uracil <br/>
T vs U, uracil is found in RNA and thymine is found in DNA <br/>
A and T are opposite to one another and G and C are opposite to one another <br />
base + sugar = nucleoside + phosphate = nucleotide <br/>
if double helix has more G and C then it is going to have more hydrogen bond then with less G and C <br/>
and so it require more energy to pull apart the two strand of double helix by breaking down the hydrogen bond <br/>


### keywords:
  replication , transcription and translation
  
## lecture 5, Notes:
RNA may have been doing the job of storing information in starting of life and gradually DNA took over the job <br/>
glycolysis, glyco prefers to sugar, lysis is breaking down of certain compunds. <br/>


### keywords: 
  lipids
  
## lecture 6, Notes: (prof eric lander)
  genetics : study of organism - one component (mutant) <br/>
  molecular biology realised the study of genes and proteins are two different side of the same coins <br/>
  Gene: factor of inheritance controlling a trait <br/>
  Alleles: alternative forms of gene <br/>
  Phenotype : appearance <br/>
  Genotype: pair of alleles carried by the individuals like RR, Rr, rr, <br/>
  homozygotes: Genotype that has two alleles of same type like RR, rr <br/>
  heterozyotes: individual having genotype of alternative type <br/>
  word dominant and recessive prefers to phenotype not to alleles <br/>
  Meiosis is the type of cell division that creates egg and sperm cells. <br/>
  mitosis, the process of making new body cells
  
## lecture 7:
when recombination rate is 0 then it means that genes are very close to each other. <br/>
when recombination rate is 50% then the genes are on different chromosome or very far from each other 
### keywords: 
genetic map, recombination rate <br/>
  
## lecture 8: 
yeast the proper eukaryote has 16 pair of chromosomes. <br/>
yeast that are able to grow on minimal media that are known as prototrophs, Auxotrophs are the yeast <br/>
that lost the ability to grow on minimal media. <br/>
arginine auxotrophs: organism that are unable to grow and make their own organism and hence needs the supply of arginine to grow <br/>
characterising mutant by the test of recessivity

### kewywords: 
haploid and daploid <br/>
complementatation group in genes ? <br />

## lecture 9:
brca-1 mutation, high risk of breast cancer <br/>
chromosome 17 bonafide autosome (what does it means) <br />
autosomal chromosome:chromosome that are not sex chromosomes means they do not define the sex of the offsprings <br/>

### keywords:
epistasis <br/>
sex-linked trait, <br/>
sex limited trait <br>
autosomal ?<br/>
cystic fibrosis <br />

## lecture 10:
  bacteriophage, phage means eaters <br/>
  semi conservative replication:one strand is used as template to replicate another <br/>
  
### keywords: 
  s-strain bacteria and R-strain bacteria <br/>
  radioactive labelling
  
## lecture 11:
  

## she has her mother laugh 
each mitochondria carries 37 genes of its own which encodes protein essential for its task <br/>
mitochondria divides on their own making a copy of their own DNA without meiosis <br/>
only mothers mitochondria becomes the mitochondria of their child <br/>
what is nucleotide polymorphism ? <br/>
Rh factor should be same between blood donor and receiver <br/>
how does the new mutation arise in human DNA <br />
what is heretability in a trait ? <br/>
Heritability does not indicate what proportion of a trait is determined by genes and what proportion is determined by environment.<br/>
So, a heritability of 0.7 does not mean that a trait is 70% caused by genetic factors; it means than 70% of the variability in <br/>
the trait in a population is due to genetic differences among people.
### (key words):
 gene drive ? <br />
 transoceanic amnesia <br />
 pedigree <br/>
 ectoderm
 mesoderm
rece plasm <br/>
heretibality <br/>
